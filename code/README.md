1) main_using_neuralnet.py: 
	is the main that could be run on a data set of interest;
	it uses neuralnet.py and funtions.py

2) create_data_files.py: 
	script used to create different types of data which then could be modelled with neural networks

Function scripts:
a) neuralnet.py:
	it's the module that actually implements the "mechanics" of neural networks
b) functions.py:
	a set of functions callable by main_using_neuralnet.py
