NeuralNets
==========

code for basic implementation of neural networks module


Created when I was trying to understand Neural Networks based on the write up in http://www.philbrierley.com/code.html

It was 'perfected' through multiple iterations of 'email conversations' with Phil.  
At this point it's still basic, but it works beautifully on the 5 data sets. 

I recommend running it in iPython (e.g., spyder in Anaconda Analytics), then the graphs that show convergence as the program runs.
